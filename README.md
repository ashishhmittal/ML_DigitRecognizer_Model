# ML_DigitRecognizer_Model
Famous MNIST Digit Recognizer dataset prediction model based on Convolutional Neural Networks. With accuracy of 98%, you can achieve accuracy of 99% if you train on more than 30 epochs, i have only trained this model on 1 epoch only.
Could not upload  training and testing datasets because they are too large and GitHub doesnot support files larger than 25MB.
But datasets can be found on Kaggle this is the link https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data you can downoad them here.
